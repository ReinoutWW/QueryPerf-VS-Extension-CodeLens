As it's a demo version, a dataset should be directly at this directory: `C:\CodeLens\CodeLensSourceData3.csv`

Follow this CSV format:
```
Tag,QueryCount,UniqueUserCount,"BytesSent_Min","BytesSent_Max","BytesSent_Avg","BytesSent_Total","BytesReceived_Min","BytesReceived_Max","BytesReceived_Avg","BytesReceived_Total","TotalBytes_Min","TotalBytes_Max","TotalBytes_Avg","TotalBytes_Total","Rows_Min","Rows_Max","Rows_Avg","Rows_Total","Columns_Min","Columns_Max","Columns_Avg","Columns_Total","ExecutionTime_Min","ExecutionTime_Max","ExecutionTime_Avg","ExecutionTime_Total"
```
